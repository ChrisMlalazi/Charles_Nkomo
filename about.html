              <p class="para">Born and bred in Bulawayo, I did my art studies at Mzilikazi Art and Craft Centre in Bulawayo where I specialised in fine art.</p> 
              <p>After graduating from there, I became a resident artist at the National Art Gallery in Bulawayo.</p>
              <p> While at the art gallery I participated in solo and joint exhibitions, and also had the opportunity to get commissions to paint  murals for organisations like the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Co-operation for example.</p> 
              <p>Over the years I have found fulfilment as an abstract expressionist.</p>
              <p>My technique involves a unique blend of colours with the latest works being experimentations with bold bright colours with prominent figurative style in either pallet knife or strokes.</p> 
              <p>My subject matters are influenced by the current socio-political-economic situation of the day while others are timeless abstract and postmodern works hence the broad appreciation of my artwork by people of diverse backgrounds from all around the world. I am happy to say that I now have a global audience for my work which began from humble beginnings</p>

              <h3> Contacts</h3>

              <p>I am now resident in South Africa, and I welcome invitations for exhibitions or commissioned paintings work from anywhere in the world. <br> You can get in contact on my Facebook page at in the menu bar at the top email, call or whatsapp:</p>
