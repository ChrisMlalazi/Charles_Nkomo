     <div class="bio">
      	
            <p>Born and bred in Bulawayo, I did my art studies at Mzilikazi Art and Craft Centre where I specialised in fine art. After graduating from there, I became a resident artist at the National Art Gallery in Bulawayo. While there I participated in solo and joint exhibitions, and also had the opportunity to get commissions to paint  murals for organisations like the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Co-operation for example. Over the years I have found fulfilment as an abstract expressionist. My technique involves a unique blend of colours with the latest works being experimentations with bold bright colours with prominent figurative style in either pallet knife or strokes. My subject matters are influenced by the current socio-political-economic situation of the day while others are timeless abstract and postmodern works hence the broad appreciation of my artwork by people of diverse backgrounds from all around the world. I am happy to say that I now have a global audience for my work which began from humble beginnings</p>
